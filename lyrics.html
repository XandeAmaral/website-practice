                <pre>
            I was a ghost, I was alone, hah
            어두워진, hah, 앞길 속에 (ah)
            Given the throne, I didn't know how to believe
            I was the queen that I'm meant to be
            I lived two lives, tried to play both sides
            But I couldn't find my own place
            Called a problem child 'cause I got too wild
            But now that's how I'm getting paid, 끝없이 on stage
            
            I'm done hidin'
            Now I'm shinin' like I'm born to be
            We dreamin' hard, we came so far, now I believe

            We're goin' up, up, up, it's our moment
            You know together we're glowing
            Gonna be, gonna be golden
            Oh, up, up, up with our voices
            영원히 깨질 수 없는
            Gonna be, gonna be golden
            Oh, I'm done hidin'
            Now I'm shinin' like I'm born to be
            Oh, our time, no fears, no lies
            That's who we're born to be

            Waited so long to break these walls down
            To wake up and feel like me
            Put these patterns all in the past now
            And finally live like the girl they all see

            No more hiding
            I'll be shining like I'm born to be
            'Cause we are hunters
            Voices strong, and I know I'll believe

            We're goin' up, up, up, it's our moment
            You know together we're glowing
            Gonna be, gonna be golden
            Oh, up, up, up, with our voices
            영원히 깨질 수 없는
            Gonna be, gonna be golden

            Oh, I'm done hidin'
            Now I'm shining like I'm born to be
            Oh, our time, no fears, no lies
            That's who we're born to be

            You know we're gonna be, gonna be golden
            We're gonna be, gonna be
            Born to be, born to be glowin'
            밝게 빛나는 우린
            You know that it's our time, no fears, no lies
            That's who we're born to be
